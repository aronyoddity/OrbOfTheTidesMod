# Orb of the Tides Mod

## Overview

The **Orb of the Tides** mod introduces a mystical artifact into Stardew Valley, granting players the power of teleportation. With this orb, you can set a custom teleportation point anywhere on the map and return to it at will.

**Note:** The Orb of the Tides will soon be obtainable as a treasure chest item deep within the Sea Cavern in the Cape Stardew mod.

## Features

- **Custom Teleportation:** Use the orb to set a teleportation point anywhere on the map by right-clicking, and teleport back to that location when needed.
- **Dynamic Orb Effect:** When activated, the orb surrounds the player with a transparent visual effect, creating an immersive teleportation experience.
- **Portal Marker:** A visual indicator, displayed as a portal, will mark your teleportation point on the map, ensuring you always know where you're headed.

## Installation

1. Download and extract the mod files.
2. Place the files into your Stardew Valley `Mods` folder.
3. Launch Stardew Valley and enjoy the added convenience of teleportation!

## Usage

- **Set Teleport Point:** Right-click with the orb to set a teleportation point at your cursor's location on the map.
- **Teleport:** Left-click with the orb to bring up a prompt asking if you want to teleport to the set location.
- **Reset Teleport Point:** The teleport point can be reset by right-clicking again, going to bed, saving, or starting a new day. (Note: The 'G' key for resetting the location is currently not functional.)

## Known Issues

- **Teleport Point Placement:** Some users may experience difficulties setting the teleport point in specific locations on the map. This will be addressed in future updates.
